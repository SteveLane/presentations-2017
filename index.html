# Models

- We all use models
- Models demand assumptions
- Assumptions should be checked
- Deviations should be accommodated

---
class: top, left

# Statistical models

- Statistical models help account for:
    - The assumptions we make;
    - The variations we see;
    - The deviations we accommodate.

Not everyone uses statistical models

**But they should!**  .bigr[ðŸ¤”]

# ðŸŽ² Dice rolling

Suppose you have a die, and every time you roll it you make a note of whether the value was less than or equal to 2 (L), or greater than 2 (G).

A series of rolls may look like the following:

.center[
L  G  G  G  L  G  L  G  G  G
]

--

### Let's tell a story

We can motivate our observations, by telling a story.

---

# ðŸŽ² A dice rolling story

A simple story for this example tells us how the observations come about:

- we roll the die `\(n\)` times
- the probability of rolling less than or equal to 2, is `\(p\)`
- a single roll of the die results in `\(\{1, 2\}\)` with probability `\(p\)`, or `\(\{3, 4, 5, 6\}\)` with probability `\(1-p\)`
- every roll of the die is independent from all other rolls

### We then encode our story in a formal probabilistic model

---
name: dice-model

# ðŸŽ² A dice rolling model

Let's translate our story into a model. First, let `\(C\)` be the number of times the die shows less than or equal to 2. Then, if

1. we roll the die `\(n\)` times;
2. the probability of rolling a 2 or less is a constant, `\(p\)`; and
3. each of the rolls is independent

we may assume that `\(C\)` has a Binomial distribution:

`$$\begin{align*}
C &amp; \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)
\end{align*}$$`

--

&lt;hr&gt;
.center[
L  G  G  G  L  G  L  G  G  G
]
In our previous example, `\(C=3\)`.

---

# The Binomial (more generally)

.center[

&gt; More generally, if we find ourselves in situation where we have two outcomes in our story (and the [previous assumptions](#dice-model) hold), we can make use of the Binomial distribution.

]

### Examples

- presence/absence
    - e.g. a noxious weed
- survival
    - e.g. testing of new biological controls for cane toads

---

# How can we use such a model?

There are two main ways:

- How well do the observations we make, support the model and its assumptions?
    - Assume the model is true, and assess the compatibility of the data
- Given a model and some decision criteria, how much effort should be made?
    - Assume the model is true, and assess the effect of various hypothetical scenarios (e.g. classic sample size considerations)

# What are our defences?

- Not importing anything ðŸ¤”
- Not allowing any passenger movement ðŸ¤”
- Sourcing from pest free areas
- Treatments prior to export
- Inspection (possibly at random, but often mandatory)
- Post-entry quarantine

---

# Inspection

So far the focus has been national; but there are equally strict quarantine measures at our state borders. For example, there are [permanent quarantine stations](http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/biosecurity/fruit_fly/bringing_fruit_and_vegetables_into_south_australia) as you head into South Australia.

On roads entering South Australia without permanent quarantine stations, there are disposal bins; these are likewise monitored, with random inspections occurring post-bin location.

---

# Hypothetical: A new inspection method

Let's suppose you and your team devise a new biosecurity awareness campaign for travellers entering South Australia. To test the campaign, you perform random inspections of vehicles after they pass the disposal bins. Historically, the proportion of vehicles carrying fruit&lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt; is 5%; you stop 100 vehicles, and find none of them carried fruit!

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt;Or biosecurity risk material more generally.
]

### How do you interpret this?

--

- think about assumptions

--

- assume Binomial, `\(F \sim \text{Binomial}(100, 0.05)\)`

--

- calculate: `\(\Pr(F=0)=0.6\%\)`

# Imports of fresh garlic

.pull-left[

In the previous example, we could inspect all the vehicles.

We can't inspect all garlic in all consignments!

# How much effort should we make?

We should agree on certain measures, for example the [International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures](https://www.ippc.int/en/core-activities/standards-setting/ispms/).

### *Zero risk is unattainable and undesirable*

Beale, R., Fairbrother, J., Inglis, A., &amp; Trebeck, D. (2008). *One Biosecurity: a Working Partnership*. Commonwealth of Australia.

### Example

We agree to inspect enough garlic, such that the probability of detecting contamination within a consignment is sufficiently high. For example, a 95% probability of detection, if the contamination rate is 0.5% or higher.

---

# An inspection problem

Suppose you select 200 bulbs of garlic from a consignment; after a thorough inspection, you find zero of the bulbs are contaminated.

How confident are you that the consignment does not contain any contaminated garlic? (I.e. in the bulbs you *didn't* inspect).

&gt; Another way of thinking about this is to assume the consignment contains some garlic bulbs that are contaminated. What is the probability that our sample of 200, contains 1 or more of the contaminated bulbs? Note: we want this to be high!

---

# An inspection problem, cont'd

- assume the Binomial model again, `\(X \sim \text{Binomial}(200, 0.5\%)\)`
    - and further, that the consignment contains contaminated bulbs
- calculate `\(\Pr(X=0)\)`



The probability that our sample contains 1 or more of the contaminated bulbs is:

`$$\begin{equation}
\Pr(X \geq 0) = 1 - \Pr(X = 0) = 1 - 0.37
\end{equation}$$`

ðŸ¤”, `\(63.3\%\)` that's not very confident&amp;hellip;

---

# An inspection problem, cont'd

What we really want, is to figure out *how many* bulbs of garlic to inspect, to ensure that we have a high probability of detecting contamination.

We need to turn our previous thinking on its head: assume `\(X=0\)` and `\(p=0.5\%\)`. Then how big does `\(n\)` have to be to ensure `\(\Pr(X\geq0|n,p=0.5\%)\)` is *large* enough?

### Example

--

Let's say we want the probability of detecting contamination to be greater than 95%; then assuming a Binomial model with `\(p=0.5\%\)`,

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;\(n\) needs to be &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;greater than 598&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

# Non-constant `\(p\)`

How do we deal with non-constant `\(p\)`?

For example, which consignments should we target on the fruit pathway? And even more so, which suppliers within particular tariffs?
